# Airline Reservation System

## Description
The objective of this project is to design and develop an airline reservation system. The primary function would be to enable a customer to book airline tickets. It will allow the customer to make bookings/search for flights through different ways such as by choosing the convenient source and destination places or by favorable dates. It shall also enable the user
to modify his/her bookings. This system will be a real-time system, and the pricing of the tickets will vary with time. Each new customer will be required to make a login account with their details, which enables them to reach the booking stage. The same account can be used again for future bookings.
